    "    - You can have any code you want inside of that block -- `if`, `print`, `len`, `input`, or even another `for` loop.\n",
    "    - When the indented block ends, the \"body\" of the loop ends, as well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "What's happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `for` loop turns to `s`, the object, and asks it: Are you iterable? Can I run a loop on you?\n",
    "    - If the answer is \"no,\" we get an exception.\n",
    "2. If the object is iterable, then the `for` loop says: Give me your next value.\n",
    "    - If there are no more values, then the object says so, and the loop ends.\n",
    "3. If there is a value, then it is assigned to `one_character`, our variable\n",
    "4. The loop body executes\n",
    "5. We return to step 2, asking for the next value.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we learn at least two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the variable has **no effect** on what we get with each iteration. You can call your variable whatever you want; the name is useful to developers, and Python couldn't care less.\n",
