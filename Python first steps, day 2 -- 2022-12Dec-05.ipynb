    "We've seen that different types of data can be stored in different types of structures. Each structure provides us with different functionality and speed trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are really small and very fast -- but very annoying if we're going to use them for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are great for text - but very annoying if we want to store multiple things (that aren't characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are great for collections -- but very annoying if I just want to hold onto the text of a book or article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking:\n",
    "- Integers are for whole numbers, and floats are for numbers with a fractional part\n",
    "- Strings are for text (of any length), or collections of characters\n",
    "- Lists are the go-to ordered collection in Python.  Lists can contain anything at all, and can be any size we want. We can append to the end, and we can remove from anywhere.\n",
    "- Tuples are Python's version of structs or records. They are immutable, but more importantly, we typically use tuples when we have a collection of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "- If I have a text document, I'll store that in a string.\n",
    "- If I have a few words that our company wants to be sure are never used in a press release, then we could put those in a list, and search for each of them in outgoing correspondence.\n",
    "- If I have information about an employee -- their name, age, address, and salary -- then I'll put those in a tuple, because it's a collection of information of different types."

    "\n",
    "Every Python environment is a bit different, but in Jupyter, you have a few ways to get help, and to find out what your options are.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At any point, you can press `TAB` to complete your options. If you press `TAB` halfway through a variable name, then Python will try to complete it. If the completion is ambiguous, then it'll show you a menu of possibilities. If you're after a `.`, then it'll show you all of the methods that you can invoke on that type of object.\n",
    "2. You can use the `help` function to find out more about something, as in `help(len)` or `help(str.upper)`. Notice that if I'm getting help on a function, I don't invoke it with `()`, but just pass its name as an argument to `help`.\n",
    "3. You can put any variable, function, or other name in Jupyter, and put a `?` after it, to get information about it. If you use `??`, you'll sometimes get more information, such as the definition of a function"
